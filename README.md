# [M6-A1] Data Science Integrative Project

**Due:** Sep 2 by 11:59pm  
**Points:** 100  
**Submitting:** a file upload  
**Available until:** Sep 3 at 11:59pm

## Overview

In this group project (2-4 students), you will bring together everything you've learned in the course to explore how data science can be applied responsibly and effectively to solve real-world problems.

Your team will step into the role of a data science group hired to design a Student Success Dashboard that helps educators better understand and support students. You will use a real dataset [Download dataset](link) to apply systems thinking, data governance, data cleaning, and exploratory analysis. Here is the [data dictionary](link).

**Note:**

- [ ] This project needs to be worked on in a group. Individual submissions will incur a straight 25% penalty.
- [ ] Groups need to be finalized by Monday. If you have formed a group by then, drop me a message on Teams with the name of the group and members. If you haven't formed a group or prefer to be assigned to a random group, drop me a message on Teams too. Either way, I expect a message from you before 5 pm on Monday.

## Instructions

### 1. Understand the Scenario (Systems & Governance)

**Map the system:**

- [ ] **Identify the parts:** Who are the actors (students, teachers, administrators, policymakers, parents)?
- [ ] **Look for interconnectedness:** How do these actors interact through data? (e.g., grades → reporting → interventions → student outcomes).
- [ ] **Spot feedback loops:** Does data drive decisions that then affect the data being collected? (e.g., low attendance → more support → attendance improves).
- [ ] **Anticipate delays:** Will the impact of data-driven decisions show up immediately or only after a semester/year?
- [ ] **Watch for unintended consequences:** Could focusing on one metric (like test scores) harm others (like student wellbeing)?

- [ ] **Apply the 5 Ws of data governance (Who, What, When, Where, Why).**

- [ ] **Identify key ethical risks (privacy, fairness, bias).**

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)

- [ ] Explore the dataset: nulls, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- [ ] Prepare a cleaned version of the dataset for analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Analysis (Python)

- [ ] Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, distributions) - univariate analysis.
- [ ] Create 2–3 graphs (e.g., scatterplots, bar charts, histograms) that reveal relationships - multivariate analysis.
- [ ] Highlight potential correlations or trends (e.g., study time vs. grades, attendance vs. dropout risk).

### 4. Conceptual Automation & Prediction

- [ ] Identify 4-5 variables you would include in a conceptual predictive model and share why?
- [ ] Explain what the model would predict or classify (e.g., risk of dropout, likelihood of success).
- [ ] Discuss risks if predictions are wrong or biased, and how the system could be monitored for fairness.

### 5. Integrative Reflection and Report

- [ ] Document Point 1, 3 and 4 in this report (~2-3 pages)

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- [ ] Describe the key concepts, roles, and processes involved in data science
- [ ] Identify and categorize sources of data and demonstrate how data can be used to support decisions
- [ ] Explain why data quality, privacy, and ethics matter in working with data
- [ ] Use basic methods to process, explore, summarize, and draw conclusions with data
- [ ] Analyze how data flows through larger systems and assess its impacts on people and organizations
- [ ] Investigate data-related problems and clearly communicate insights in a professional context

## Deliverables

**Group Report (2-3 pages) including:**

- [ ] Team name and members
- [ ] Systems map + governance analysis (systems map + 5 Ws + ethical / privacy issues)
- [ ] 2–3 graphs and statistical insights
- [ ] Conceptual predictive model description

- [ ] **Jupyter Notebook w/ Python code**

- [ ] **Presentation recording (5–7 minutes per group) summarizing findings and insights.**
